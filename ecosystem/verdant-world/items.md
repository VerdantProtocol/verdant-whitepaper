#### Strategic Insights

* **Bombs** lower a rival miner’s defences, eventually disabling them and halting their yield production.
* **Shields** strengthen your defences against incoming attacks.
* **Restore and Revive** items are essential for long-term miner survival after PvP or maintenance failures.
* **Morph** allows you to scale a miner into a more powerful, rarer class — a major advantage.
* **Expansion** increases your fleet size, boosting your overall yield potential.

Verdant’s item system turns simple yield farming into a **competitive, tactical game** — where smart use of offense, defence, and recovery items defines the top players.
