### $VDNT – Verdant Token (Core Currency)

* The **native token** of Verdant and the only tradeable token within the ecosystem,
* Used to buy and maintain miners, play arcade games, and interact with the protocol’s features.
* Subject to taxes on key actions to maintain long-term sustainability.

#### Tax Structure (applied to $VDNT)

| Action                           | Tax (%) | Notes                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Buying $VDNT                     | 10%     | Applied on entry into the protocol  |
| Selling $VDNT                    | 10%     | Sell tax, to discourage fast exits  |
| VDNT → BLM (Bloom)               | 10%     | Conversion tax, part of compounding |
| VDT (Verdite) -> VDNT redemption | 10%     | Claiming rewards from miners        |

### &#x20;$BLM – Bloom (Utility Currency)

* **In-game utility token** used to purchase miners and pay maintenance.
* Converted 1:1,000 from VDNT. (i.e. 1 VDNT = 1,000 BLM)
* Burned and consumed through miner upkeep and upgrades.
* Also used in the Arcade to play games and access limited features.

#### 🔁Role of Bloom

* **Token sink:** BLM is frequently spent and removed from circulation via miner decay and arcade losses.
* **Transaction buffer:** Enables flexible pricing for assets without affecting $VDNT directly.

### $VDT – Verdite (Reward Currency)

* This is what miners generate every day.
* Cannot be directly used; must be **claimed and converted** to VDNT (with tax).
* Functions as a **“raw yield”** currency, providing earnings over time.
* Helps isolate emissions from VDNT supply directly.

### Economic Flywheel

The core Verdant loop works like this:

1. 💳 **Buy $VDNT** (entry point into the ecosystem — taxed 10%)
2. 🔄 **Convert $VDNT → BLM** (used for all in-game activity — taxed 10%)
3. ⛏️ **Use BLM to buy miners**
4. 💰 **Miners generate $VDT daily**
5. 🔁 **Claim $VDT → Convert to $VDNT** (taxed 10%)
6. 🔄 **Convert $VDNT → BLM** again to maintain or expand your miner fleet (taxed 10%)
7. 🎮 **Optionally, spend $VDNT in the Arcadium** — Verdant’s retro-style game hub
8. 🔥 **Taxes, burns, and token sinks** across the system reduce inflation and support long-term sustainability

### Sustainability by Design

* **Taxes reduce inflation** and fund development
* **Maintenance and Arcade burns** act as token sinks
* **Decay mechanics** ensure passive players don’t extract endlessly
