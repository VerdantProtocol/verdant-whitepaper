# Verdant World

***

Miners are the core engine of _**Verdant**_. They are digital units that generate rewards over time. But be careful, these aren't idle generators. Miners demand upkeep, strategy, and timing. This mechanism transforms passive yield into an _**interactive economy**_**.**

***

## The Miners

There are three different miner levels in Verdant:

* _**Basic**_
* _**Advanced**_
* _**Elite**_

Each miner offers different rewards generation and scaling potential.&#x20;

Rewards are paid out continuously in _**Verdite ($VDT)**_ - not to be confused with _**Verdant ($VDNT)**_, the core ecosystem token. _**Verdite**_ can be refined into _**Verdant**_.

> üí° Info: Rewards are paid out in _**$VDT**_, but maintenance can only be paid in _**$BLM**_. _**$VDT**_ must be refined into _**$VDNT**_, and exchanged for _**$BLM**_. You cannot convert _**$VDT**_ directly into _**$BLM**_.

_**Storage Cap**_ - The total amount of $VDT a miner can hold before rewards stop accumulating. Miners must be emptied regularly to avoid missing out on rewards - emptying doesn't mean refining.

### How Miners Work

* **Generation:** Miners begin generating _**Verdite**_ the moment they‚Äôre deployed.
* **Maintenance:** You must pay to maintain your miner(s) every 7 days. Each miner has 2 Health Bars - these cannot be restored without ultra-rare _**Mythic Items**_. If you miss payment on 2 maintenance windows back-to-back, the miner _**self-destructs**_.
* **Perseverance:** Provided you keep to the maintenance schedule, your miners will last indefinitely. Don't forget to empty the miners once in a while, either, otherwise you'll be losing out on precious rewards.
* **Expansion:** Refine your _**Verdite,**_ exchange your _**Verdant**_ for _**Bloom**_ and expand your miner arsenal. Unlock new heights!

***

### Miner Health

Each miner has only 2 _**Health Bars**_. A _**Health Bar**_ is lost when you fail to make your weekly maintenance payment. Once a miner has lost 2 _**Health Bars**_, it will _**self-destruct**_. You will then have to purchase a brand new one.

* üîß **1 Missed Repair** = 1 Health Bar Lost
* üíÄ **2 Missed Repairs** = Goodbye Miner

Weekly maintenance is paid in _**Bloom ($BLM)**_. Bloom can only be obtained through _**Arcadium**_ or by exchanging _**Verdant ($VDNT)**_.

There exists a _**Mythic Item**_ - Perfect Repair Kit - that can restore a damaged miner to full health. However, _**Mythic Items**_ are ultra-rare and highly sought-after.

### Example Strategy

Alice begins her adventure in _**Verdant World**_:

1. She buys her first miner, a _**Basic Miner**_ for **50,000&#x20;**_**$BLM**_
2. She earns 5.56 _**$VDT**_ each day and maintains it weekly for only 4000 _**$BLM**_
3. She carefully managed her rewards and spends them on more miners when possible
4. Within a few weeks she obtains all _**Basic Miners**_ and graduates to _**Advanced Miners**_
5. Alice keeps mining away until she eventually reaches the _**Elite Miners**_

***

### Why It Works

The mining model has been meticulously designed for longevity and fairness. It blends reward with responsibility:

* üß† **Game Theory:** Dedicated players thrive, lazy ones decay. Increase your share of a protocol with ever-growing utility and gamification.
* üîÅ **The Flywheel:** Reinvesting rewards leads to exponential gains, gains give you more opportunity to win big in the casino.
* üî• **Rewards** **Emission Control:** Maintenance costs, token sinks and utility ensures that the protocol remains sustainable by having external revenue sources.
