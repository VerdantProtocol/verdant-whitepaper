### Verdant ($VDNT) - Core Currency

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Main (1).png" alt="" width="256"><figcaption><p><strong>Verdant ($VDNT)</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Maximum Supply</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**- 21,000,000**</mark>
* The **Native Token** of Verdant and the only tradeable token within the ecosystem,
* Used to buy and maintain miners, play arcade games, and interact with the protocol‚Äôs features.
* Subject to taxes on key actions to maintain long-term sustainability.

#### Tax Structure

<table><thead><tr><th width="302">Action</th><th width="85">Tax</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Buying $VDNT</td><td>10%</td><td>Buy Tax - Protocol Fee</td></tr><tr><td>Selling $VDNT</td><td>10%</td><td>Sell Tax - Discourages quick exits</td></tr><tr><td>Exchanging $VDNT for $BLM</td><td>10%</td><td>Conversion Tax - Stabilizes compounding</td></tr><tr><td>Refining $VDT to $VDNT</td><td>10%</td><td>Rewards Tax - Moderates gains from miners</td></tr></tbody></table>

Taxes are critical for Verdant World to function sustainably. They work as a function of moderating rewards generation. The goal is to offer lucrative ROI, whilst not destabilizing the protocol. Without the tax structure, people would scale exponentially faster and hyper-deflation would set in.

In addition, taxes enable us to develop infrastructure more rapidly and pay for marketing. They are a necessary mechanism for ensuring project health.

* **Utility Token & Primary Currency** for Verdant World.
* Bloom is consumed through deployment of miners, payment of miner maintenance fees and participation in Arcadium.
* $VDNT can be exchanged at 1:1000 from for $BLM. (I.E. 1 $VDNT = 1,000 BLM).

#### üîÅRole of Bloom

### Sustainability by Design

* **Taxes reduce inflation** and fund development
* **Maintenance and Arcade burns** act as token sinks
* **Decay mechanics** ensure passive players don‚Äôt extract endlessly
