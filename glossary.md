# Glossary

#### **$VDNT** (Verdant Token)

The native utility and governance token of Project Verdant. Used for accessing core mechanics, purchasing miners, and participating in the Verdant Arcade.

***

#### **$BLM** (Bloom)

An in-ecosystem utility token used to purchase and maintain miners. Converted from $VDNT at a fixed rate of **1 VDNT = 1,000 BLM**.

***

#### **$VDT** (Verdite)

The reward token earned by miners. Players claim $VDT and convert it to $VDNT (taxed), enabling compounding or profit-taking. Converted to $VDNT at a fixed rate of **1 VDNT = 5,000 VDT**.

***

#### **Miners**

Digital units that generate $VDT rewards daily. They come in three tiers:

* **Tier 1 – Basic Miner**
* **Tier 2 – Advanced Miner**
* **Tier 3 – Elite Miner**

Each tier has different costs, yields, and maintenance requirements.

***

#### **ROI** (Return on Investment)

The percent return a miner generates annually based on cost vs. net reward output. Higher-tier miners offer faster and more significant ROI — but come with greater cost.

***

#### **Maintenance**

Miners must be repaired **every 7 days** using BLM or VDNT. Failure to maintain twice in a row leads to **self-destruction**. Maintenance serves as a deflationary sink.

***

#### **Decay**

The process by which a miner loses “lives” when unmaintained. Two missed repairs = miner is destroyed and stops earning.

***

#### **Self-Destruct**

The irreversible state when a miner is not maintained for two consecutive weeks. It removes the miner from circulation.

***

#### **Compounding**

The process of reinvesting $VDNT rewards to purchase additional miners or upgrade tiers. It's the main scaling strategy for long-term players.

***

#### **Liquidity Pool (LP)**

A decentralized exchange pool pairing $VDNT with a stablecoin (e.g., USDC). $VDNT’s price is determined by the constant product formula used in platforms like Uniswap.

***

***

#### **Burn Mechanism**

A percentage of taxed tokens (especially from Arcade losses) are burned — permanently removed from supply, creating deflationary pressure.

***

#### **Tax Structure**

Taxes are applied to several key actions:

* **10% Buy Tax** (on $VDNT)
* **10% Sell Tax** (on $VDNT)
* **10% Tax on $VDT → VDNT conversion**
* **10% Tax on $VDNT → BLM conversion**

***

#### **Arcadium**

An 8-bit-styled game suite where users can spend $Bloom to play minigames. A portion of all $Bloom used is burned, and top players earn cosmetic items or prizes.
