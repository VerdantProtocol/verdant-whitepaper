# Miners

Miners are the core yield-generating assets within Verdant World. Players deploy miners to earn daily rewards, maintain their operations, and defend their holdings against PvP attacks. Each miner type has unique characteristics that impact strategy and potential returns.

### Miner Pricing

Miners are purchased using **$BLM**. Pricing is based on a **fixed percentage of the $VDNT liquidity pool**, meaning miner prices scale with $VDNT's price growth â€” but not exponentially â€” keeping access fair for all players.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Example:**</mark>\
If the liquidity pool contains 100,000 $VDNT, an Elite Miner (1.5%) costs **1,500 $VDNT**.\
Since miners are bought with $BLM, the player pays **1,500 Ã— 1,000 = 1,500,000 $BLM**.

### Capacity and Yield

Each miner accumulates rewards over time up to its capacity limit.\
Players must **claim rewards** once capacity is full to resume earning; otherwise, rewards stop accumulating until claimed.

### Maintenance

Miners must be maintained weekly.

Each miner has only 2 _**Health Bars**_. A _**Health Bar**_ is lost when you fail to make your weekly maintenance payment. Once a miner has lost 2 _**Health Bars**_, it will _**self-destruct**_. You will then have to purchase a brand new one.

* ðŸ”§ **1 Missed Repair** = 1 Health Bar Lost
* ðŸ’€ **2 Missed Repairs** = Goodbye Miner
* ðŸª™ &#x57;_**eekly maintenance cost = 10% of Weekly ROI**_

Weekly maintenance is paid in _**Bloom ($BLM)**_. Bloom can only be obtained through _**Arcadium**_ or by exchanging _**Verdant ($VDNT)**_.

### PvP Mechanics: Bombs and Shields

Miners are vulnerable to attacks from other players:

* **Each miner starts with 2 shields and 2 lives.**
* When bombed, a miner **loses one shield** per hit.
* At **zero shields**, the miner becomes **DISABLED** and stops generating yield.
* Players must use a **revive item** to reactivate a disabled miner.
* While disabled, the maintenance countdown continues â€” failure to maintain can still destroy a miner.

Strategic use of shields, maintenance, and timing attacks against opponents is critical to survival and maximizing rewards.
