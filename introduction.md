# Introduction

### Welcome to Project Verdant

Somewhere between the rusted roots of forgotten machines and the neon buzz of arcade lights, **Project Verdant** was born.

Verdant isn’t your average farm-and-dump DeFi scheme. It’s a living, breathing ecosystem where yield doesn’t just appear — it’s _mined_, _maintained_, and _played_.\
\
At its core lies a trio of miners — each with its own mechanics, reward, and lifespan. They grow. They wither. They die. And in their cycle, they feed the network.

But Verdant isn’t just about numbers. Beyond the mining rigs and reward loops is **BitSprout**, a pixel-perfect arcade layer where your tokens become tickets to risk, chance, and glory. Whether you’re playing Crash to chase multipliers or burning tokens for exclusive cosmetics, the game is always on.

Here, sustainability isn’t a pitch — it’s a mechanic. Lifespans, maintenance, rising costs… these aren’t bugs, they’re features. Verdant’s economy was designed to be anti-abuse, anti-infinite-print, and pro-fun.

> “Verdant rewards those who nurture, plan, and play — it’s a world where your choices bloom”

So build your farm, tend your miners, and roll the dice in this innovative new universe built on Abstract.

### Protocol Overview

**Project Verdant** is a dual-layered DeFi protocol that blends strategic yield farming with interactive gameplay.

It’s made up of two core components:

#### 🛠 **The Miner System — “Root Engine”**

A time-based yield mechanism where users purchase digital miners that generate rewards over fixed durations. Miners decay over time, require maintenance, and self-destruct if neglected. The system includes three tiers (T1–T3), each with distinct costs, lifespans, and ROI. T3s are limited in supply and dynamically priced via the liquidity pool.

#### 🎮 **The Arcade Layer — “BitSprout”**

A pixel-art-inspired game layer where users can spend their tokens in mini-games, gamble, or unlock cosmetics. Games like Crash, Loot Boxes, and PvP challenges act as **burn mechanics**, reducing supply and rewarding engagement. BitSprout is where yield becomes interactive.

Together, these systems create a sustainable, deflationary ecosystem where **strategy, timing, and participation** define success.
