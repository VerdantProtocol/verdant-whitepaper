# Currencies & Conversions

### Verdant ($VDNT) - Core Currency

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Main (1).png" alt="" width="256"><figcaption><p><strong>Verdant ($VDNT)</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Maximum Supply</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="color:yellow;">**- 21,000,000**</mark>
* The **Native Token** of Verdant and the only tradeable token within the ecosystem,
* Used to buy and maintain miners, play arcade games, and interact with the protocol’s features.
* Subject to taxes on key actions to maintain long-term sustainability.

#### Tax Structure

<table><thead><tr><th width="302">Action</th><th width="85">Tax</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Buying $VDNT</td><td>10%</td><td>Buy Tax - Protocol Fee</td></tr><tr><td>Selling $VDNT</td><td>10%</td><td>Sell Tax - Discourages quick exits</td></tr><tr><td>Exchanging $VDNT for $BLM</td><td>10%</td><td>Conversion Tax - Stabilizes compounding</td></tr><tr><td>Refining $VDT to $VDNT</td><td>10%</td><td>Rewards Tax - Moderates gains from miners</td></tr></tbody></table>

Taxes are critical for Verdant World to function sustainably. They work as a function of moderating rewards generation. The goal is to offer lucrative ROI, whilst not destabilizing the protocol. Without them, people would scale exponentially faster and hyper-deflation would set in.

### Bloom $BLM - Utility Currency

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Bloom (2).png" alt="" width="256"><figcaption><p><strong>Bloom ($BLM)</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

* **In-Game Utility Token** used to purchase miners and pay maintenance.
* Converted 1:1,000 from VDNT. (i.e. 1 VDNT = 1,000 BLM)
* Burned and consumed through miner upkeep and upgrades.
* Also used in the Arcade to play games and access limited features.

#### 🔁Role of Bloom

* **Token sink:** BLM is frequently spent and removed from circulation via miner decay and arcade losses.
* **Transaction buffer:** Enables flexible pricing for assets without affecting $VDNT directly.

### Verdite ($VDT) - Reward Currency

* This is what miners generate every day.
* Cannot be directly used; must be **claimed and converted** to VDNT (with tax).
* Functions as a **“raw yield”** currency, providing earnings over time.
* Helps isolate emissions from VDNT supply directly.

### Economic Flywheel

The core Verdant loop works like this:

1. 💳 **Buy $VDNT** (entry point into the ecosystem — taxed 10%)
2. 🔄 **Convert $VDNT → BLM** (used for all in-game activity — taxed 10%)
3. ⛏️ **Use BLM to buy miners**
4. 💰 **Miners generate $VDT daily**
5. 🔁 **Claim $VDT → Refine into $VDNT** (taxed 10%)
6. 🔄 **Convert $VDNT → BLM** again to maintain or expand your miner fleet (taxed 10%)
7. 🎮 **Optionally, spend $VDNT in the Arcadium** — Verdant’s retro-style game hub
8. 🔥 **Taxes, burns, and token sinks** across the system reduce inflation and support long-term sustainability

### Sustainability by Design

* **Taxes reduce inflation** and fund development
* **Maintenance and Arcade burns** act as token sinks
* **Decay mechanics** ensure passive players don’t extract endlessly
