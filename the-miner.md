# The Miner

#### 🧱 Miner Tiers

There are **three types of miners**, each offering different risk and reward profiles:

| Tier         | Cost (VDNT) | ROI % | Daily VDT    | Lifespan | Max per Wallet | Global Cap      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **BASIC**    | 500         | 159   | \~2.78 VDT   | 105 Days | 5              | No Cap          |
| **ADVANCED** | 5,000       | 288   | \~41.67 VDT  | 75 Days  | 3              | No Cap          |
| **ELITE**    | 50,000      | 585   | \~833.33 VDT | 45 Days  | 1              | **100 Total** ✅ |

#### 🛠 How Miners Work

* **Earning**: Once purchased, a miner starts producing **$VDT** daily. This continues until it reaches the end of its lifespan.
* **Decay**: Every 7 days, miners require **maintenance**. If you forget to repair a miner twice in a row (2 missed weeks), it self-destructs.
* **Lifespan**: Each miner type only lives for a certain number of days. After that, it stops earning and must be replaced.
* **Reinvestment**: Many players choose to use their rewards to buy more miners or upgrade tiers — creating a **compounding loop**.

#### 🧰 Maintenance & Repair Kits

To keep your miners alive and efficient, you’ll need to **maintain them weekly** using **Repair Kits**, which can be bought using **$VDNT** or **$BLM**.

* Skipping a repair = miner loses 1 “life”
* 2 missed repairs = miner destroyed 💀
* Kits are priced affordably and serve as a **token sink**

#### 📈 Dynamic T3 Pricing

T3 miners are **powerful but limited**. There are only **100 in existence**, and every time one is purchased, the price increases — not from a fixed chart, but because of the liquidity pool mechanics.

> 🧪 Example: The first T3 might cost \~$250. The 20th T3? Over $600.\
> Early movers get rewarded, latecomers pay a premium.

This discourages whales from flooding the system and helps control emissions naturally.

#### 🧠 Example Strategy

Let’s say Alice starts with a single T1 miner:

* She pays 500 VDNT and starts earning \~2.78 VDT per day
* She remembers to maintain it weekly (only costs a few cents)
* After 30 days, she’s earned enough to buy a second T1
* She compounds — doubling her rewards
* Eventually, she’s earning enough to jump to a T2 or even aim for a T3

#### 🌿 Why It Works

Miners in Verdant aren’t forever — and that’s the point. The system encourages:

* 📆 **Planning**: Lifespans and repair cycles make timing matter
* 🔁 **Compounding**: Reinforce growth or you’ll fall behind
* 🧱 **Scarcity**: Limited T3s and rising costs curb runaway emissions

This is how **Project Verdant balances yield with sustainability** — while keeping things fun, strategic, and rewarding.
