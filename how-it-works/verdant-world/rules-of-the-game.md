<mark style="color:yellow;">**To maintain fairness and strategic depth, Verdant World enforces the following PvP rules:**</mark>

1. **Grace Period:**\
   After a miner is bombed but survives (still has shields > 0), it becomes **immune to further attacks for 24 hours**.
2. **No Attacks During Grace:**\
   You **cannot attack** a miner that is under its 24-hour grace period.
3. **Item Rarity Matching:**\
   Item rarities **must match** the minerâ€™s rarity. Only bombs and items of the same tier can affect a miner.\
   &#xNAN;_(Exception: Morph items upgrade a miner and match the upgraded rarity.)_
4. **Life Loss Mechanism:**\
   A miner's **life is lost only** when **maintenance is missed**, **not** when it is bombed.
5. **Unclaimed Rewards on Destruction:**\
   If a miner is **destroyed** (loses all lives), **all unclaimed rewards are lost permanently**.
6. **Shield Limit:**\
   The maximum number of shields a miner can have is **4 shields**.
7. **Incorrect Item Use Penalty:**\
   Incorrect use of bombs (e.g., wrong rarity, attacking during grace period, or targeting a disabled miner) will **still consume** the bomb, even though no effect is applied.
