### What is the arcadium

The Arcadium is a suite of **on-chain, 8-bit-style minigames** built directly into the Verdant ecosystem. Every game in the Arcadium uses **Bloom** ($BLM). \
\
The Arcadium will feature both single and multi-player games so you can compete with your friends.

Players can wager tokens, earn rare rewards, unlock cosmetics, or simply risk it all for glory.

***

### Key Features

* The 8-bit world of Verdant is just beginning — beneath the arcadium lies fertile ground for a full-blown on-chain RPG, where your miners become characters, your yield becomes an in-game currency with insane utility, and **The Arcadium** evolves into a living, breathing pixel economy.
* **Play-to-Burn**: Tokens collected inhouse by the house edge are burned! Creating deflationary pressure and a sink for $VDNT.
* **Gamified Yield**: Instead of just passively earning, users can multiply or lose rewards through skill or luck.
* **Cosmetics & Utility Items**: Unlock special skins, power-ups, or vanity assets by participating in arcadium events.
