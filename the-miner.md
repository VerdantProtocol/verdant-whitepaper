# The Miner

***

Miners are the core engine of **Project Verdant** — self-contained digital units that yield rewards over time. But these aren’t idle generators. In Verdant, miners demand upkeep, strategy, and timing. This transforms passive yield into an **active, gamified economy.**

***

### Miner Overview

Each miner tier offers different yield potential, pricing, and scaling opportunity. Rewards are paid out continously in **$VDT** which can thereafter be exchanged for **$VDNT.**

<table><thead><tr><th>Tier</th><th width="165">Cost Bloom ($BLM)</th><th>Yearly ROI (%)</th><th width="146">Weekly VDT</th><th width="197">Weekly Maintenance Cost</th><th>Max Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Basic</td><td>50,000 BLM</td><td>406%</td><td>194,444 VDT</td><td>4000 BLM</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced</td><td>500,000 BLM</td><td>608%</td><td>2,916,667 VDT</td><td>60,000 BLM</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Elite</td><td>5,000,000 BLM</td><td>1217%</td><td>58,333,333 VDT</td><td>2,000,000 BLM</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

> 💡 Note: 10% Tax applies on $BLM purchases and $VDT -> $VDNT redemptions. There are no restrictions on when you can harvest your rewards.

### How Miners Work

* **Earning:** Miners begin generating $VDT the moment they’re activated.
* **Decay:** Every 7 days, your miner must be **maintained**. Your miners have 2 health bars (**that cannot be restored**). If you skip 2 maintenance windows back-to-back, the miner **self-destructs**.
* **Persistence:** Miners last indefinitely with proper maintenance — turning them into long-term productivity assets.
* **Scaling Loop:** Reinvest rewards to scale up miner count or upgrade to higher tiers — creating a compounding economy.

***

### Maintenance

To keep your miners running at full output, you’ll need to maintain them weekly by paying in **Bloom** ($BLM).

| Tier     | Weekly Maintenance Cost |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Basic    | 4000 BLM                |
| Advanced | 60,000 BLM              |
| Elite    | 2,000,000 BLM           |

* 🔧 **1 missed repair** = 1 life lost
* 💀 **2 missed repairs in a row** = miner destroyed

### Example Strategy

Let’s say Alice begins with a T1:

1. She buys her first Basic Miner for **500 VDNT**
2. She earns \~5.56 VDT/day and maintains it weekly for only \~4.84 VDNT
3. She compounds weekly, adding more miners to her farm
4. Within weeks, she earns enough to leap into Tier 2
5. Alice sees her daily income increase as she continues to compound.

***

### Why It Works

Project Verdant’s mining model is designed for **longevity and fairness**, blending reward with responsibility:

* 🧠 **Game Theory:** Smart players thrive, idle ones decay. Increase your share of a protocol with ever-growing utility and gamification.
* 🔁 **Compounding Flywheel:** Reinvestment leads to exponential gains
* 🔥 **Emission Control:** Maintenance costs, token sinks and utility ensures that the protocol remains sustainable by having external revenue sources.
