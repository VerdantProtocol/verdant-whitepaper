# The Arcade

***

### What is the arcade

The Arcade is a suite of **on-chain, 8-bit-style minigames** built directly into the Verdant ecosystem. Every game in the Arcade uses **Bloom** ($BLM)

Players can wager tokens, earn rare rewards, unlock cosmetics, or simply risk it all for glory.

***

#### 🔥 Key Features

* **Play-to-Burn**: A portion of every wagered $VDNT gets burned, making the Arcade both fun and deflationary.
* **Fast & Addictive Games**: Each game is designed to be quick, rewarding, and emotionally engaging — like classic arcade hits.
* **Gamified Yield**: Instead of just passively earning, users can multiply or lose rewards through skill or luck.
* **Cosmetics & Utility Items**: Unlock special skins, power-ups, or vanity assets by participating in arcade events.
