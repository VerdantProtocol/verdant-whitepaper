# Verdant World

Miners are the core engine of _**Verdant**_. They are digital units that generate rewards over time. But be careful, these aren't idle generators. Miners demand upkeep, strategy, and timing. This mechanism transforms passive yield into an _**interactive economy**_**.**

***

## The Miners

There are three different miner levels in Verdant:

* _**Basic**_
* _**Advanced**_
* _**Elite**_

Each miner offers different rewards generation and scaling potential.&#x20;

Rewards are paid out continuously in _**Verdite ($VDT)**_ - not to be confused with _**Verdant ($VDNT)**_, the core ecosystem token. _**Verdite**_ can be refined into _**Verdant**_.

> 💡 Info: Rewards are paid out in _**$VDT**_, but maintenance can only be paid in _**$BLM**_. _**$VDT**_ must be refined into _**$VDNT**_, and exchanged for _**$BLM**_. You cannot convert _**$VDT**_ directly into _**$BLM**_.

_**Storage Cap**_ - The total amount of $VDT a miner can hold before rewards stop accumulating. Miners must be emptied regularly to avoid missing out on rewards - emptying doesn't mean refining.

_**Algorithmic Scaling**_ - Whilst Verdant does not feature any inflation mechanics, we deploy algorithmic-scaling to ensure the rewards (and cost) of miners do not overwhelm the ETH reserves in the liquidity pool. Effectively, the cost and rewards do not linearly scale - they do not remain a fixed value. Values gradually fall as we cross the 8-figure market cap threshold, along with rewards. However, these values fall from what they would be provided linear scaling, not from your purchase price. In simple terms, cost and rewards still go up as the price goes up, but stop going up as much once certain thresholds are hit.

### How Miners Work

* **Deployment:** Once deployed, Miners begin generating rewards in _**Verdite**_.
* **Management**: As Verdite accumulates in your Miner(s), their storages fill. Once their storages are full, they can no longer accumulate rewards. Empty miner storages regularly to prevent precious rewards being lost.
* **Maintenance:** Miners require weekly maintenance. Each miner has 2 Health Bars - these cannot be restored without ultra-rare _**Mythic Items**_. Missing two weeks of maintenance results in the miner _**self-destructing**_.
* **Expansion:** Refine your _**Verdite,**_ exchange your _**Verdant**_ for _**Bloom**_ and expand your miner arsenal. Unlock new heights!
* **Perseverance:** Following the rules will see your miners last indefinitely, and you will receive bountiful supply of rewards.

### Miner Health

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Miner Health - Seen indicated through hearts</p></figcaption></figure>

Each miner has only 2 _**Health Bars**_. A _**Health Bar**_ is lost when you fail to make your weekly maintenance payment. Once a miner has lost 2 _**Health Bars**_, it will _**self-destruct**_. You will then have to purchase a brand new one.

* 🔧 **1 Missed Repair** = 1 Health Bar Lost
* 💀 **2 Missed Repairs** = Goodbye Miner

Weekly maintenance is paid in _**Bloom ($BLM)**_. Bloom can only be obtained through _**Arcadium**_ or by exchanging _**Verdant ($VDNT)**_.

There exists a _**Mythic Item**_ - Perfect Repair Kit - that can restore a damaged miner to full health. However, _**Mythic Items**_ are ultra-rare and highly sought-after.

### Example Strategy

Alice begins her adventure in _**Verdant World**_:

1. She buys her first miner, a _**Basic Miner**_ for **50,000&#x20;**_**$BLM**_
2. She earns 5.56 _**$VDT**_ each day and maintains it weekly for only 4000 _**$BLM**_
3. She carefully managed her rewards and spends them on more miners when possible
4. Within a few weeks she obtains all _**Basic Miners**_ and graduates to _**Advanced Miners**_
5. Alice keeps mining away until she eventually reaches the _**Elite Miners**_

***

### Why It Works

The mining model has been meticulously designed for longevity and fairness. It blends reward with responsibility:

* 🧠 **Game Theory:** Dedicated players thrive, lazy ones decay. Increase your share of a protocol with ever-growing utility and gamification.
* 🔁 **The Flywheel:** Reinvesting rewards leads to exponential gains, gains give you more opportunity to win big in the casino.
* 🔥 **Rewards** **Emission Control:** Maintenance costs, token sinks and utility ensures that the protocol remains sustainable by having external revenue sources.
